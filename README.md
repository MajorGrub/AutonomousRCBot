Teaching a small RC vehicle to drive itself using machine learning (Tensorflow)

The goal is to replicate the autonomous driving system presented in a video from Andrew Ng's machine learning course, but on a smaller scale. Instead of a modified full scale car, this project will use a small RC vehicle.
